					"MySummary": "I studied Computer Engineering at Girne American University. I finished my classes 2019 May. After completing my internship, I graduated and worked at the company where I did my internship. During my courses I worked in different software languages such as C, C ++, C #, Python and Java Script. Recently, I am developing some commercial websites, mobile applications, desktop applications using C #. Thanks to the projects I've worked on, I've learned a lot about developing ASP.NET, MVC, WebAPI and WinForm applications. I also used Pyhton software language during my graduation projects. I also trust myself in database management and procedure creation. I gained a lot of experience in algorithm analysis and project planning.I am working on the Selenium Automation Development in my free times for improving myself about it.I am currently working as a SAP PI/PO colsuntant & java developer and freelancer at the same time.Although I don't have much work experience, I have been working professionally in the design and development departments for nearly 3 years."
